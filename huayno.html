<p>In the summer of 2007 I was 20 years old, had finished my sophomore year of college, and spent a lot of time driving around the suburbs with friends listening to CDs in my car. They would routinely bring their own CDs and leave them in the car for weeks or months before reclaiming them, or make mix CDs for roadtrips or as gifts. At any given time I could root around in my glovebox or the pouches behind the front seats and find a few CDs I didn't recognize.</p>

<p>For some period of time I had in my car a disc labeled 'Best of Huayno' in scrawling black marker. For a long time it sat in one of those vinyl binders which held 100 or so discs, but eventually I brought it out and listened. It contained 23 tracks of Huayno, a genre of Peruvian Andean folk music, and for a few weeks I was enthralled with its rhythms. According to Wikipedia, 'High-pitched vocals are accompanied by a variety of instruments, including quena (flute), harp, siku (panpipe), accordion, saxophone, charango, lute, violin, guitar, and mandolin. Huayno utilizes a distinctive rhythm in which the first beat is stressed and followed by two short beats.'</p>

<p>Shortly after I brought it into rotation, the disc began to skip. Assuming one of my friends would know the origin of the disc, I neglected to transfer any of the music to my computer and instead continued to listen to it whenever I drove alone. Not surprisingly, most of the friends I drove with lacked my enthusiasm for traditional Andean folk music.</p>

<p>One particular song on the CD, track 17, gave me goosebumps whenever I played it, and I would often drive with it on loop. I never would have expected to be a fan of any kind of folk music, much less a genre of another continent and culture; maybe it was that the lyrics were in another language; maybe, as a drummer, the unusual rhythms appealed to a deeper part of me; maybe it was just such a departure from everything else on rotation in my car at the time that it stuck in my brain. Whatever the case, this random CD planted the seed for a love of music from the other side of the world with little to no presence in my life up to that point. I kept listening.</p>

<p>After some months, the disc began to skip persistently, and a few weeks later it failed to play entirely. A survey of my friends and everyone who would have rode with me that summer turned up nothing. I asked friends of friends at house parties; I asked people to ask others who might have ridden with me on trips to parks, concerts, anything. Its origins were unknown to all, and no one could name a Huayno afficionado or even a suspected World Music fan among us. That fall, I called off the search.</p>

<p>Since then I have listened to dozens of Huayno compilations on Youtube, and continue to browse every now and then. I still haven't heard whatever song track 17 might have been, but I'm certain that I'll know it when I hear it. Perhaps track 17 wasn't a Huayno song; perhaps it was another genre, and whoever might have left this most random of CDs in my glovebox wasn't completely consistent in organizing their South American folk music. Maybe the point is not to find it. Maybe not finding the song is more of a reward than finding it ever could be.</p>
