In the summer of 2006 I was 19 years old, had finished my freshman year of college, and spent a lot of time driving around the suburbs with friends listening to CDs in my car. They would routinely bring their own CDs and leave them in the car for weeks or months before reclaiming them, or make mix CDs for roadtrips or as gifts. At any given time I could root around in my glovebox or the pouches behind the front seats and find a few CDs I didn't recognize.

For some period of time I had in my car a disc labeled 'Best of Huayno' in scrawling black marker. For a long time it sat in one of those vinyl binders which held 100 or so discs, but eventually I brought it out and listened. It contained 23 tracks of Huayno, a genre of Peruvian Andean folk music, and for a few weeks I was enthralled with its rhythms. According to Wikipedia, 'High-pitched vocals are accompanied by a variety of instruments, including quena (flute), harp, siku (panpipe), accordion, saxophone, charango, lute, violin, guitar, and mandolin. Huayno utilizes a distinctive rhythm in which the first beat is stressed and followed by two short beats.' 

Shortly after I brought it into rotation, the disc began to skip. Assuming one of my friends would know the origin of the disc, I neglected to transfer any of the music to my computer and instead continued to listen to it whenever I drove alone. Not surprisingly, most of the friends I drove with lacked my enthusiasm for traditional Andean folk music.

Eventually the disc failed to play entirely, and a survey of my friends and everyone who would have rode with me that summer turned up nothing. Its origins were unknown to all, and no one could name a Huayno afficionado or even a suspected World Music fan among us.
